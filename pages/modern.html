                    <p>In the middle of the 19th century, this was the historical moment of the arrival of the modern world stage. Because, first, the industrial revolution has been completed or rapidly developed in major European and American countries, making the spread of Western large industrial productivity to the whole world, and the world market has basically taken shape. Second, Western industrial products have been dumped to most of the world's backward countries and regions. Many countries in Asia, Africa and Latin countries have begun to develop or initially develop their own modern capitalist economy. In addition, the whole world has entered the historical era of capitalism, and the historical stage of the modern history of the world has basically arrived. At the end of the 19th century, this was the historical moment when the stage of modern world history was fully arrived. Because, first, after the second industrial revolution, the Western industrial productive forces have fully capable of spreading to the rest of the world, and the western capitalist society has begun to enter a new stage of development. Second, the capital output has already Importantly, it “accelerates the development of capitalism in the most backward countries”. Most of the world's backward countries have entered the historical period of the emergence and development of modern capitalism. Third, by the end of the 19th century, the world was divided and the world. The capitalist economic system has been formed, and the whole world has entered the era of capitalism, and the stage of modern world history has also arrived.</p>

                    <p>This view holds that people have long been accustomed to regard the modern European upper limit as the world's modern upper limit. However, due to the imbalance of world historical development, there must be a "time difference" between these two upper limits. European modern history Beginning in the 15th century, modern world history began in the 19th century. The root cause of the arrival of the modern history of the world is the formation of the industrial revolution in the West, the extremely large industrial productivity, and the ability to spread globally. It is the output of goods and the output of capital. Because of this, Asia, Africa and Latvia, which account for 80% of the world's population, entered their own modern history in the 19th century. Thus, the regional modern history of the past Europe and the United States expanded into a true modern world history in the 19th century. The modern history of the world began at this time. Scholars who hold this view believe that the second half of the 15th century was the transition period from the Middle Ages to the modern history of Europe. By the beginning of the 16th century, Europe officially entered the stage of modern history, but until the end of the 18th century, the whole world did not enter the modern era. In the historical stage, this period is actually only the preparation period for the arrival of modern world history.</p>

                    <p>The use and development of computer technology is another major breakthrough. The tube computer in the late 1940s was the first generation computer. In 1959, a transistor computer appeared, with an operating speed of more than 1 million times per second. In 1964, it reached 3 million times. In the mid-1960s, there were many integrated circuits in which electronic components and electronic circuits were concentrated in a small area or volume, and the operation was performed ten million times per second. It was suitable for general data processing and industrial control, and was convenient to use. In the 1970s, it developed into a fourth-generation large-scale integrated circuit. In 1978, computers could calculate 150 million times per second. Developed into a smart computer in the 1980s. Photonic computers, biological computers, etc. appeared in the 1990s. In general, every 5 to 8 years, the calculation speed is increased by 10 times, the volume is reduced by 10 times, and the cost is reduced by 10 times. China's own "Galaxy" large-scale computer can also calculate hundreds of millions of times per second.</p>
