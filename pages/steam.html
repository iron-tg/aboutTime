                    <p>The industrial revolution first began in the 1860s in the United Kingdom, and a large number of outward expansions were in the early 19th century. Therefore, from a macroscopic perspective, the second period of the modern world historyâ€”the steam era began in the early 19th century and ended in the second industrial revolution of the 1970s. During this period, the capitalist machine revolution began to appear, and the capitalist world system began to be initially established. A new kind of power machine: the invention and application of steam engine brought humanity into the steam era.</p>
                    <p>The industrial revolution and the French Revolution have strengthened the power of capitalism in material and spiritual terms. In the 1960s and 1970s, the bourgeois revolution and reform movements began around the world. The bourgeois movement of this period has two historical missions: First, in feudal countries such as Germany, Italy, Russia and Japan, it is necessary to tear down the feudal system and establish a capitalist system. As a result, Germany and Italy achieved national unity through the dynasty war and embarked on the capitalist road; Russia and Japan established the capitalist system through top-down reform. Second, in capitalist countries such as Britain, France, and the United States, it is necessary to reform the superstructure at the time of the manual workshop to adapt to the new economic foundation. As a result, the United States abolished black slavery through the Civil War; Britain passed the parliamentary reforms, and the industrial bourgeoisie took control of the state. The French industrial bourgeoisie established the Second Republic through the February 1848 revolution. Despite the differences in the specific tasks of the revolutions of various countries, it is the fundamental task of all bourgeois movements in this period to open the way for the development of industrial capitalism.</p>
                    <p>While the capitalist system was established throughout the world, the activities of the bourgeoisie to conquer the world were unprecedentedly intensified. As a result of the industrial revolution, the colonial activities of this period developed from the form of barbaric plunder to the occupation of raw materials and commodity markets. A large number of Asian and African countries and regions were forcibly incorporated into the capitalist system and became colonies and semi-colonies. So far, the capitalist system has been established in the world. Through the revolutionary reform movement and the conquest of the colonies, the capitalist world system was initially formed.</p>
