                    <p>The production activities of human beings in the primitive society were greatly restricted by natural conditions. The stone tools were generally made from local materials. They were picked up from nearby river beaches or from familiar rock areas to make suitable tools. Paleolithic tools. This is usually the case before the middle of the era, but not all of them usually have a lot of misunderstandings to the late stage. With the changes in the living environment and the accumulation of production experience, this method of picking up sometimes fails to meet production and life. In the above requirements, when conditions permit, stone materials are mined from the original rock formation suitable for stone tools to make stone tools. Therefore, some mountain areas that can provide abundant raw materials will come from the surrounding areas, mining stone from rock formations, and even making stone tools on the spot, thus appearing some stone manufacturing sites. The two stoneware manufacturing sites in Dayao Village and Qianna Moban Village in the eastern suburbs of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, were important places for humans to manufacture and collect raw materials at that time.</p>
                    <p>Dayao Village is located in the hilly area in front of Daqing Mountain. In the Sidaogou in the south of the village, there is a place where stone tools were made in the early Paleolithic period. The adjacent Erdaogou is the manufacturing site in the late Paleolithic period. At this location, there is a wide distribution of silty loess in the late Pleistocene, which is covered with a layer of black earth. At the bottom of these two layers of soil, there are thick layers of stone, stone and gravel. Among them, there are many stone fragments and stone cores, and there are few stone tools. The semi-finished products and waste products left by the stone tools are the majority. Reflects the relic features of the stoneware manufacturing site.</p>
                    <p>In the stoneware unearthed at this location, the turtle-shaped scraper is special, made of stone, with flat cracked surface, and the back is raised like a turtle's back. It is covered with processing marks. The form and method are relatively fixed and can be used for stripping. Animal skin, scraped meat and processed leather. The stoneware manufacturing site found on the brain of the Moban Village was the same as that of the Didaogou of Dayao Village, and it belonged to the late Paleolithic period. The exploitation of stone materials and the emergence of relatively fixed stoneware manufacturing sites are signs of the development of social productive forces.</p>
